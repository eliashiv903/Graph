## about the project
In this project we create a graph. On the graph we can do some algorithms. The graph is represented by vertices and edges.
The vertices are represented in the Nodedata class, and the edges are represented in the Edgedata class.
In addition, there is a class that represents a graphical interface. The graphical interface shows the graph and allows it to change the graph and make algorithms on the graph.
For example, the graphical interface shows us the graph visually:
